### Note on Terminology Consistency Between Code and Manuscript

Due to updates in the manuscript, some terms in the R code and the manuscript are not identical. Specifically:

- The term **"Circuit"** is used in the code to label different **IFFL model structures**.
- The term **"Type"** is used in the manuscript to refer to the same IFFL structures.

They represent the same set of network motifs; only the naming differs between code and manuscript.

The correspondence is as follows:

| Code Label (`Circuit`) | Manuscript Label (`Type`) |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Circuit 1              | IFFL Type 3               |
| Circuit 2              | IFFL Type 4               |
| Circuit 3              | IFFL Type 1               |
| Circuit 4              | IFFL Type 2               |

This note is intended to help avoid confusion when reviewing the simulation scripts and interpreting their results in the context of the paper.

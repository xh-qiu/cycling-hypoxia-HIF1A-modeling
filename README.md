# cycling-hypoxia-HIF1A-modeling

This repository contains the code used for modeling and experimental validation in the study:  
**Cancer Cell Adaptation to Cycling Hypoxia: Integrating Mathematical Modeling with Experimental Validation of HIF-1 Dynamics**

## Structure

The repository contains two major components:

1. **Model Simulation**
   - ODE-based dynamic modeling of HIF1A and downstream circuits
   - Parameter sweep analysis and figure generation

2. **Experimental Validation**
   - Scripts for RNA-seq, gene expression visualization
   - Analysis of experimental data under normoxia, hypoxia, and oscillatory hypoxia
